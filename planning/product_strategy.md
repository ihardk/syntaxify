# Product Strategy

> Vision, value proposition, and positioning.

---

## 1. Vision Statement

**"Own your UI, not just your components."**

Forge enables developers to define UI structure in a framework-agnostic AST, generating production-ready code for Flutter (and eventually Compose).

---

## 2. Core Principle

> Forge exists to remove repetition, not responsibility.

---

## 3. Value Proposition

### For Individual Developers
- Define once, generate for any platform
- No more copy-paste across projects
- Consistent UI without discipline effort

### For Teams
- Enforced UI structure consistency
- Reduced code review overhead
- Faster onboarding (one pattern, many screens)

### For Agencies
- Multi-client apps from same AST definitions
- Platform-specific output without code forks
- Reduced maintenance across projects

## 4. Target Audience

### Primary (Now)
| Segment             | Profile                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Solo developers     | Building apps, want consistency |
| Small teams (2-10)  | Need scalable UI architecture   |
| Flutter consultants | Deliver apps efficiently        |

### Secondary (Later)
| Segment              | Profile                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Cross-platform teams | Flutter + Compose from one source |
| Enterprise teams     | UI governance                     |

---

## 5. Competitive Landscape

| Solution    | Pros             | Cons             | Our Advantage         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Raw Flutter | Full control     | No consistency   | We add structure      |
| flutter_gen | Asset generation | No UI generation | We generate UI        |
| Widgetbook  | Component docs   | No code gen      | We generate + compose |

---

## 6. What Forge Is NOT

- NOT a runtime framework
- NOT a widget library
- NOT magic that hides generated code
- NOT a replacement for Flutter

---

## 7. 5-Stage Roadmap

| Stage | Focus                         | Status |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| 1     | Prove Feasibility             | ✅      |
| 2     | Lock Correctness & Narrative  | ⬅️ NOW  |
| 3     | Prove Power (Layout + Screen) | ⬜      |
| 4     | Make It Legible               | ⬜      |
| 5     | Career or Monetization        | ⬜      |
