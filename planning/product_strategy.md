# Product Strategy

> Vision, value proposition, target audience, timeline, and monetization.

## 1. Vision Statement

**"Own your UI system, not just your UI."**

Forge enables Flutter developers to build design systems that generate production-ready code, providing the leverage of frameworks with the control of handwritten code.

## 2. Value Proposition

### For Individual Developers
- Build once, style infinitely
- No more copy-paste across projects
- Consistent UI without discipline effort

### For Teams
- Enforced design consistency
- Reduced code review overhead
- Faster onboarding (one pattern, many components)

### For Agencies
- White-label products with design variant switching
- Client-specific themes without code forks
- Reduced maintenance across client projects

### For Enterprises
- Design system governance
- Accessibility compliance by default
- Reduced technical debt
