# Product Mission

## Vision

Syntax is a compile-time UI generator that transforms AST definitions into production-ready Flutter code, eliminating boilerplate while keeping developers in full control.

## Core Principle

> Syntax exists to remove repetition, not responsibility.

## What Syntax Is

- Compile-time code generator
- Framework-agnostic IR (AST)
- Emits plain, editable Flutter code
- Zero runtime dependencies

## What Syntax Is NOT

- NOT a runtime framework
- NOT a widget library
- NOT magic that hides generated code
- NOT a replacement for Flutter

## Target Users

- Flutter developers who want consistent UI
- Teams enforcing design systems
- Developers building multiple apps with shared patterns
