# Product Mission (Lite)

Forge is a developer tool that automates the translation of Design Systems into production-ready Flutter code, eliminating boilerplate and ensuring strict token compliance without runtime overhead.

It serves Design System Teams and Flutter Developers who struggle with keeping code synchronized with design. Unlike runtime-heavy frameworks, Forge generates pure, dependency-free Dart code that is readable and efficient.
