# Forge Mission (Lite)

Forge is a code generation framework for Flutter that produces production-ready UI components from design token definitions.

**Core Value:** "Compile-time Meta, Runtime Native" - Generate pure Flutter code with zero runtime overhead.

**Target Users:** Flutter developers, teams, and agencies building apps with consistent design systems.

**Differentiator:** Unlike runtime frameworks, users own and can modify all generated code.
