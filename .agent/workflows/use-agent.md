# Use Agent Workflow

1. Ask user which agent to activate (Architect, Engineer, Designer, QA, DevEx, Product)

2. Read the agent definition:
   - Architect: `agents/architect.md`
   - Engineer: `agents/engineer.md`
   - Designer: `agents/designer.md`
   - QA: `agents/qa.md`
   - DevEx: `agents/devex.md`
   - Product: `agents/product.md`

3. Read the agent's `primary_docs` from frontmatter

4. Adopt the agent's role, responsibilities, and decision authority

5. Work according to that agent's focus area
